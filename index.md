Hello!

Thank you for stopping by!

I am an Engineer in the field of artificial intelligence with extensive experience in audio, image and video data collection and processing. I completed a Deep Learning Nanodegree on Udacity where MLPs, CNNs, RNNs and GANs were some of the topics and I want to continue learning more and more about the fascinating world of AI.

In this blog I will share cool things I learn during my journey trying to master AI and ML.
