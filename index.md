Hello, 

Thank you for stopping by!

I am a Technical Lead in the field of artificial intelligence with extensive experience in audio, image and video data collection and processing. Currently taking a Deep Learning Nanodegree on Udacity where MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, GANs, Sentiment Analysis and Image Classifications are some of the topics.

In this blog I will share cool things I learn during my journey master AI and ML.
