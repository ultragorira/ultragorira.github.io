Hello!

Thank you for stopping by!

I am a Technical Lead in the field of artificial intelligence with extensive experience in audio, image and video data collection and processing. Currently taking a Deep Learning Nanodegree on Udacity where MLPs, CNNs, RNNs and GANs are some of the topics.

In this blog I will share cool things I learn during my journey trying to master AI and ML.
